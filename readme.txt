Duplicate posts from other WordPress blogs easily with Copy Post. Also, schedule posts to duplicate automatically. Syndicate content like a pro.

== Description ==

iPressGo Copy Post allows you to duplicate posts from any WordPress blog with the REST API enabled, onto your own WordPress blog as a draft or published. In addition, create multiple 'Copy Jobs' to automatically schedule posts to be duplicated onto your blog.

How it Works:

1. Insert any Blog Link (Home Page or Sub Category) that uses WordPress
2. Set a Start Time, Time Between Posts, Total Copy Limit, and Other Settings
3. Save your Copy Job.

With iPressGo Copy Post you can syndicate content like a pro by creating multiple Copy Jobs for various blogs and/or content categories. iPressGo Copy Jobs run in the background until you stop them or delete them.

Create higher limits for breaking news and lower limits on filler content. iPressGo Copy Post will copy the most recent post available according to the schedule and settings you configure.

You can also manually search for and copy posts available on the connected blog.
